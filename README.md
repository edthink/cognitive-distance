# Cognitive Distance
This repository will accompany the paper 'Towards a Geospatial Model of Cognitive Distance in Urban Spaces: An Objective Measure of Navigibility' by Ed Manley, Gabriele Filomena, and Panos Mavros.

The Jupyter notebook contains the methods used to generate estimates of cognitive distance from conventional GIS data. It also demonstrates the implementation of these methods in estimating cognitive distance in 16 cities.
