[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/edthink/cognitive-distance/master?filepath=Cognitive%20Distance.ipynb)

This repository will accompany the paper 'A Spatial Model of Cognitive Distance in Cities' by Ed Manley, Gabriele Filomena, and Panos Mavros.

The Jupyter notebook contains the methods used to generate estimates of cognitive distance from conventional GIS data. It also demonstrates the implementation of these methods in estimating cognitive distance in 26 cities (see input folder).
